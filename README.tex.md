# Fuzzy $\texttt{(ST)}^{2}$ Algorithm

In this project we have implemented a new algorithm for the all epsilon good arms problem in the stochastic MAB setting. The implementation is based on @blakemas's implementation of the Finding all epsilon good arms which can be found in https://github.com/blakemas/all_epsilon.

### Dependencies:
Numpy, Pandas
